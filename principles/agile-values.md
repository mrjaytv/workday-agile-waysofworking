# Agile Values (HRIS & Workday Context)

## Purpose
This document defines how the **Agile Manifesto** is applied within **HRIS and Workday delivery**.

Agile in HR technology is not about speed alone — it is about delivering **safe, compliant, and people-centered systems** that support the employee lifecycle.

These values guide **decision-making, prioritization, and delivery behavior** across HR, IT, and business partners.

---

## The Agile Manifesto
We value:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan  

While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## HRIS Interpretation of Agile Values

### 1. Individuals and Interactions **Over processes and tools**

**HRIS Meaning**
- HR systems exist to support people, not the other way around
- Collaboration across HR, IT, Finance, and vendors is essential
- Clear communication reduces rework and risk

**How This Shows Up in Workday**
- Early involvement of HR partners during design
- Regular touchpoints between functional and technical teams
- Transparent decision-making and escalation paths

---

### 2. Working Software **Over comprehensive documentation**

**HRIS Meaning**
- Configurations and integrations must function reliably in production
- Documentation supports delivery — it does not replace validation
- “Configured” is not the same as “ready to operate”

**How This Shows Up in Workday**
- End-to-end testing is mandatory
- Integrations are monitored post-deployment
- Documentation focuses on *how to operate and support*, not just how to build

> HRIS Principle: *If it isn’t safe for payroll or compliance, it isn’t done.*

---

### 3. Customer Collaboration **Over contract negotiation**

**HRIS Meaning**
- The “customer” includes HR, employees, managers, and downstream systems
- Ongoing collaboration reduces surprises and misalignment
- Success is measured by adoption and trust, not ticket closure

**How This Shows Up in Workday**
- Business partners engaged throughout the sprint
- Feedback incorporated early and often
- Tradeoffs discussed transparently

---

### 4. Responding to Change **Over following a plan**

**HRIS Meaning**
- HR priorities evolve due to regulatory, workforce, or business changes
- Agile HRIS teams adapt without compromising system stability
- Plans are guides, not constraints

**How This Shows Up in Workday**
- Backlogs reprioritized based on business need
- Releases adjusted around blackout periods
- Architectural decisions revisited as complexity grows

> HRIS Principle: *Adaptability must never compromise control.*

---

## Additional HRIS-Specific Agile Values

### Stability Is a Feature
- Payroll, benefits, and compliance are mission-critical
- Stability is not opposed to agility — it enables it

---

### Security and Compliance Are Non-Negotiable
- Least-privilege access
- Clear audit trails
- Separation of duties

Agile HRIS teams build **trust through control**, not shortcuts.

---

### Documentation Enables Scale
- Documentation is lean, intentional, and current
- Playbooks exist so teams can operate without heroics
- Decisions are recorded to preserve architectural intent

---

### Integrations Are Products
- Owned, monitored, and supported
- Designed for resilience, not just connectivity
- Tested across lifecycle events

---

## What These Values Enable

When applied consistently, these values lead to:
- Predictable releases
- Reduced production incidents
- Faster onboarding of new team members
- Stronger partnership between HR and IT
- Systems that scale with the business

---

## Living Document
This document is reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with:
- Organizational maturity
- Regulatory requirements
- Workday platform evolution

---

## Philosophy

> *“Agile HRIS delivery succeeds when people trust the system — and the system just works.”*
